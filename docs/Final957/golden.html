        <p>In 1938 the still developing comic book industry was shaken by the publication of <span id="title">Action Comics</span>. There had been comic strips before with heroes, but never like the one depicted in this one, this was the birth of the superhero. <span id="title">Action Comics No.1 </span> is the first appearance of Superman, which gave him a brief introduction of who he was, the powers he possessed and showed him saving people.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> Those 13 colorful pages made Superman a strong presence in the media, he had become a star in comic books, newspaper strips, radio, cartoons, movie serials, and television. The introduction of Superman to the world created a pantheon of superheroes in the Golden Age, but only a few managed to cross into other medias like Superman.</p>
        <p>Superman was a creation of Jerry Siegel, the writer, and Joe Shuster, the artist. Born in Cleveland in 1914, Jerry was a Jewish boy who was an outcast with a very active imagination. Right before turning sixteen, his father passed away from a heart attack. This became a turning point for Siegel, he would focus on make believe stories more than ever. Characters he created before merged into a single one called “The Super-Man”, the first story was written after his father’s death. This early version of Superman had extraordinary strength, telescopic vision, the capacity to read minds, and determined to rule the universe. The character first appeared in The Reign of the Superman a short story from <span id="title">Science Fiction: The Advance Guard of Future Civilization</span> issue three, a high school magazine, published by Siegel in 1933 with illustrations from Shuster. Siegel and Shuster met in high school, both shared a love for science fiction and comics that made them work well together. The story kept developing; the character dropped “the”, the hyphen and the desire to rule the universe, he would use his powers to help those in need.  Part of Jerry’s inspiration for Superman came from ancient times the Greek and Roman demigods, like Perseus and Hercules, and more recent times like Popeye the Sailor Man and Tarzan.<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> After high school they kept trying to submit their character to newspapers and magazines, but they were constantly rejected. They were able to publish stories on newspapers, but not their Superman character since editors were not interested. By this time the character was changing in order for publishers to become interested, there was no thought of Superman adapting to different mediums. When National Allied Publications was sold and changed names to Detective Comics Inc, later DC, a new comic book magazine was made, <span id="title">Action Comics</span>. The new editors saw potential in the Superman story to launch the comic book. Superman was sold for $130, when they signed their contract they were signing over the rights to the character to the publisher.<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup>  </p>

		    <p>The Golden Age of comics started when the comic book came out in June 1938. Superman became known as the world’s first superhero in <span id="title">Action Comics No.1</span>. At this time Superman was not able fly, he could “leap 1/8 of a mile; hurdle a twenty story building, raise tremendous weights, run faster than an express train and nothing less than a bursting shell could penetrate his skin.”<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup> Superman was almost an instantaneous hit, and the sales of following issues of <span id="title">Action Comics</span> rose quickly. As the world was faced with the possibility of a global war, with the Nazi threat in Europe, Superman quickly became a representation of truth, justice, strength and determination. Superman was also being sold as a daily newspaper strip and in the summer of 1939 he got his own comic. By that time <span id="title">Action Comics</span> was selling nearly a million copies per issue and <span id="title">Superman</span> over five hundred thousand copies per issue. During the war years every issue of superman sold more than a million copies.<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup> The comics were very popular that new writers and artist were hired to keep up with the demand. The popularity of the character made it jump to a different medium, the radio. </p>

		    <p>By 1940 the radio was the primary entertainment medium of its time, nearly every home and office had one. “The Adventures of Superman” began airing from 1940 to 1951 and produced by Robert and Jessica Maxwell. To make the as innovative as the print version they had to find the right voice actor, Bud Collyer was the voice for Superman and Clark Kent. He had the ability to change the tone of his voice, which made the audience know when Superman appeared in the story. The radio show had to change key elements from the comics, like the abilities, personality and characters. Some of these changes became popular enough to influence the comic books, the place where Clark Kent worked changed from The Daily Flash to The Daily Planet, Jimmy Olsen started in the radio show and was later on added to the comics, Superman had the ability to fly in the radio and that power eventually moved to the comics. This Clark Kent was more like Superman than he ever was in the comics or in the movies, since displayed courage and initiative. The first episode of the radio show does not have Superman; it gave him a different origin, describing the last days of Krypton.<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup> The second episode explains that the baby that was sent from Krypton to Earth, grows up on the flight and was educating himself in the process. Immediately after landing on Earth Superman rescues an old man and a boy, and out of the blue got the name Clark Kent and a career.<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup> This incarnation of Superman had the ability to fly, while in the comics he could only run fast and jump high. The reason he was able to fly was because the special effects team created a flying sound effect that made listeners believe man can fly.  The changes to the character were needed to create a story that was more exciting to listen. <span id="title">The New York Times</span> commented on the radio show saying that the language used in the show was appropriate in incorporating Superman’s views. The producers kept their minds on the issue, which is to entertain the audience; he reflected the times and became a participant in them.<sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup> The events happening around the world ended up making an impact on the superheroes across all media. </p>

		<p>The Golden Age happened during the Second World War shaping many of the superheroes created at the time. Marvel Comics, rival to DC Comics, created a patriotic character who was often shown fighting the Axis powers of World War II, Captain America was a popular character during the 1940s wartime period.  Some of the changes made to Superman across mediums were in order to keep up with competition and showing an understanding of what the public needed at the time. In the years of the war the character moved from vigilante to a symbol of American values. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Japanese started to appear on American comic book covers, <span id="title">Action Comics</span>, <span id="title">Superman</span>, and <span id="title">Worlds Finest</span> had Superman fighting in the front lines. In the comic books Superman was rarely involved in the war outside of the cover images. Many of the covers were used as propaganda, in <span id="title">Superman #18</span> (Sep. 1942) shows Superman riding a bomb going down, the cover does not specify the location but has the caption: “WAR SAVING BONDS AND STAMPS DO THE JOB ON THE JAPANAZIS!”<sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup> The artist Fred Ray drew some of the covers that were Japanese related before getting drafted by the war. The character became a way to increase the support for the war, making Superman define what America is. In the newspaper comic strips, in cartoons and on the radio Superman was shown much more involved in the war effort.<sup><a href="#10">10</a></sup> During the war years the radio Clark Kent is able to become a secret service officer, but in the newspaper comics he never officially served the armed forces because he failed the physical by accidentally looking through the wall with his x-ray vision and reading the wrong eye chart. This way Superman could be involved with the war but not be fighting in the front lines. Most of the war related stories dealt with Japanese as the enemy in direct response to the events in Pearl Harbor. Superman or any other superhero could not be involved directly with stopping the war since they could probably end the war in a couple of hours and it would diminish the efforts the troops put in winning the war.  The Superman in the newspaper comics written by Whitney Ellsworth and Al Schwartz in 1943, dealt with investigating the conditions of a Japanese internment camps established shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor.  The story ends with Superman reminding people that “most Japanese Americans are loyal citizens” which created some outrage and people wanted it censored.<sup><a href="#11">11</a></sup> Superman succeeded in other media animated and live action film during the war years. The Superman animated cartoon serials produced by Fleischer Studios the appeared in movie theaters from 1941 to 1943. This was one of the most expensive cartoon series ever produced by Paramount, the first episode cost 50 thousand dollars more than three times what Paramount spent on the production of the Popeye cartoon.  The cast of the radio show provided the voices for the cartoons.<sup><a href="#12">12</a></sup> The cartoon originally had Superman fighting robots, mad scientist, and dinosaurs, but Japan found its way into storylines when Paramount Studios bought Fleischer. At the time Paramount’s animated features displayed an unusual amount of war related content in early 1940s<sup><a href="#13">13</a></sup>. Two of the episodes show Superman fighting against the Japanese; these story lines never impacted the rest of the superman mythos in other media. </p>

		<p>Superman was not seen in film until 1948 when Columbia Pictures produced a 15 chapter series of short films. By the time the film adaptation was shown the war was over, this became a way to reintroduce Superman with another change to his origins. In the original comics Superman came from Krypton as a baby and was raised in an orphanage, then in the radio he grew up on his way to Earth, in this incarnation he was found by the Kent’s as a baby and was raised by them. This became a come common origin story to Superman. The first live action Superman was Kirk Alyn who was made to do most of his Superman stunts without a double, putting himself in dangerous situations.  Due to the nature of the technology it was harder to create special effects, when Superman had to carry people to save them, Alyn actually had to carry them for however many takes and make it seem effortless, since Superman had extraordinary strength. The ability to fly was also something that was complicated to film, and many times Alyn almost fell and sometimes got injured. This interpretation of Superman tried to follow the comics as much as possible. Alyn told reporters that he did not wanted to disappoint the kids and he took the role seriously so he patterned his performance from the comics.<sup><a href="#14">14</a></sup> The sequel to <span id="title">Superman</span> (1948) was <span id="title">Atom Man vs. Superman</span> (1950) this was the last time Alyn would be successful, he was typecast as Superman and could not get hired, this turned into hatred for the character. While the sequel was being filmed there were plans to bring the Man of Steel to television, but this adaptation would replace everyone. Robert Maxwell producer of the radio series was in charge of the television series. The series came at the dawn of the Silver Age, viewer expectations started to change once they saw the character across different mediums.</p>
