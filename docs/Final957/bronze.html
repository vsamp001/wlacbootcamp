      <p>Although the Civil Rights movement started in the 1960s, DC comics did not represent African American characters in their comics until the 1970s. The Bronze Age started in the 1970s, DC Comics modernizes Superman’s environments and characters. He changes professions from a newspaper reporter to a news anchor, his powers are reduced and he finally starts encountering African American characters more often than before. Writers would often express their opinion through the characters on political issues. The Superman stories at the time would put him and the supporting cast in a society that was still figuring out how to practice race relations during the Black Power movement. <sup><a href="#24">24</a></sup> The first notable black character in a Superman comic occurred in <span id="title">Superman #234 </span>(Feb. 1971), which showed that there black Kryptonians before the planet was destroyed. <sup><a href="#25">25</a></sup> It is not known if the first appearance of the black Kryptonian was because the creative team was colorblind or if it was the unnamed colorist who made that decision. Mark Waid a writer gave a good explanation for the ethnic homogeneity of Krypton, “a lack of ethnicity was an error of omission and I’m not sure given the time that it’s fair to call that “racist.” [Jerry] Siegel and all those who followed in the crafting of the Superman legend were, indeed, simply following the traditions of the Golden Age of Science fiction.” <sup><a href="#26">26</a></sup> But the comic that addressed the need for African Americans to embrace Caucasian allies was in <span id="title">Superman’s Girl Friend Lois Lane #106</span> (Nov. 1970). <sup><a href="#27">27</a></sup>  The story starts with Lois wanting to write an article about Metropolis’ district named Little Africa; she tries to interview every African American she saw would not talk to her. An activist named Dave Stevens accuses her of being racist; it is then when Superman suggests changing her skin color for 24 hours, in one of his machines, so the locals of Little Africa can accept her. Lois Lane’s perspective completely changes, the African Americans would now accept her and she is also belittled by her Caucasian taxi-driver friend. Dave Stevens gets shot and is in need of blood; Lois is able to give some blood, but soon after the effects on her skin war off. She is scared of what Stevens would say after knowing that he had her blood, the story ends with Stevens being surprised but grateful and they keep being friends. The representation of African Americans on Superman comics was a way to describe how Caucasian allied to the development of black rights movements tried to support in the movement. <sup><a href="#28">28</a></sup>

<p>With the retirement of Mort Weisinger in 1971, a new modern perspective was brought to the character. On the <span id="title">Superman </span>comic the editor Julius Schwartz and the writer Dennis O’Neil came up with a different Superman. The first thing done was making him the most powerful he had ever been by taking away his weakness, build him up, then ground him by weakening him. The story arc started in <span id="title">Superman #233</span> and ran until <span id="title">Superman #244</span>, by the last issue Superman was left with a third less of his powers than before. If Superman represents American way the reduction of power, can be interpreted as the United States losing power. By 1971 the United States was realizing that the Vietnam War would not end with their victory. O’Neil’s story line follows the path that the United States were taking, when Superman is invulnerable he is using his powers as a force for good in the world but when he loses his powers, he tries to hide it. The United States was losing its power to win the Vietnam War. The parallels between O’Neil’s Superman and the political situation of the Vietnam war within the United States, serves as an anti-war commentary. “In this Superman becomes a cautionary tale about power that could resonate powerfully for public enmeshed in Cold War nuclear fears and Vietnam War Disillusionment.” <sup><a href="#29">29</a></sup> This level of commentary was not continued because O’Neil left the series early because of felling that his work was not fitting in with the audience of children. </p>

		<p>On other mediums like cartoons the focus stayed with children, which kept the kid-friendly type stories going. In 1973 Hanna-Barbera gained the rights of DC Comics superheroes, this time the adaptation was from the popular comic book <span id="title">Justice League of America</span>. The Justice League of America was a book that had DC Comics superheroes working together to defeat villains. Hanna-Barbera animated the <span id="title">Justice League of America</span> but renamed it <span id="title">The Super Friends</span>. The show started in 1973 and ended in 1986, the characters in the show were Superman, Batman and Robin, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, two teenagers Marvin and Wendy and their pet Wonder Dog. This series was very silly and contained no violence, the common theme was that these superheroes could not solve problems on their own; they could only succeed when they work together. <sup><a href="#30">30</a></sup>    The show kept changing but the central theme remained the same, to tech children to work together. </p>

		<p>By the end of the Bronze Age Superman was returning to theaters. In 1978 the first of 4 movies starring Christopher Reeve premiered, <span id="title">Superman: The Movie</span>. Directed by Richard Donner the movie is based on Superman and is a retelling of his origin, it stars Marlon Brando, Gene Hackman, Christopher Reeve, Margot Kidder, Glenn Ford, Phyllis Thaxter, Jackie Cooper, Trevor Howard, Marc McClure, Terrence Stamp, Valerie Perrine, and Ned Beatty. The film shows Superman’s infancy as Kal-El of Krypton and when he was a kid in his hometown of Smallville. Disguised as reporter Clark Kent, he adopts a mild-mannered personality in Metropolis and develops a romance with Lois Lane, the villain of the film was Lex Luthor. The film cost $55 million, <span id="title">Superman</span> was released in December 1978 to critical acclaim and financial success, earning $300 million when it was released in theaters. <sup><a href="#31">31</a></sup>  The use of special effects and science fiction in the film made the character popular again, setting an origin that mainstream people could understand. This is one of the first success stories of comic book adaptations with newer technology that could make the viewer believe that the superhero could be real. The following movies were not able to adapt correctly and were not as successful as the original, but this gave a template to other superhero adaptations. </p>
