      <p>The defining characteristics during the Silver Age were the Cold War and the censorship imposed on the comic book superheroes across the mediums. The Silver Age is the period from the 1950s to 1960s and was dominated by fantasy and “what if stories” Superman’s origin is made more science fiction and his powers expanded exponentially. The United States was in a period of immense power and growth but with one big threat, the Soviet Union. With the Soviet Union exploding its first atomic bomb in 1949 the United States was no longer the only superpower. The fear of entering a nuclear war became part of pop culture and made its way into the superheroes across all media.  In 1951 as a trial run for a possible TV series, a short film <span id="title">Superman and the Mole Men</span> was filmed.  George Reeves replaced Kirk, and <span id="title">The Adventures of Superman </span>TV show ran from 1952 to 1958. The opening of the series shows the idea that Superman was a symbol for the idealized vision of America, he would be in front of a flag with the narrator saying that he “fights an never ending battle for truth, justice and the American way.”  The show never really contained any Cold War propaganda since it mainly consisted of simple detective stories. The television show replaced the radio show; people started watching more TV than listening to the radio. When the show started filming it was for black and white television, but in November 1954, the episodes started to be filmed in color, even though most of the homes at the time could not receive color broadcasts. The change to color and the new censorship guidelines marked a change in the tone of the show with less fighting than before. The only reason the show did not continue was that in 1959 George Reeve died. Mort Weisinger worked as story editor on the TV show before going to New York to work on comic books. Weisinger and his writers changed their approach from the realism of the TV series and the comic stories and created scenarios that could not be duplicated on film or TV. No other media form existed where “scenes of men tossing planets at one another could be created with any degree of believability.” <sup><a href="#15">15</a></sup> Under Weisinger the stories, Superman reached power levels of gods and the stories were influenced by his therapy sessions.</p>

<p>In the comic books Superman began to face cosmic threats and villains as strong as himself. This can reflect America’s foreign policy, to maintain order in the world through the use of force against bad guys, helping the poor and protects against communism. The one of the biggest fear at the time was nuclear radiation; the nuclear testing was contaminating the areas with radiation. The radiation contaminated the environment and the food supply, which caused sickness, and in some cases death. <sup><a href="#16">16</a></sup>  In Superman, radiation is associated with kryptonite. In 1943 the Superman radio series introduced kryptonite, a meteorite fragment that could weaken and could even kill Superman. It was not introduced into the comics then because National Comics because the story had Superman revealing his identity to Lois Lane. <sup><a href="#17">17</a></sup> The first use in the comic books occurs just a few months after the USSR exploded its first atomic bomb in August 1949. In <span id="title">Superman #130</span> (July 159), Superman explains that radiation “penetrate[s] my otherwise invulnerable skin and change the red corpuscles of my blood stream to green! I’ll become victim to blood-poisoning.” <sup><a href="#18">18</a></sup> Only lead is strong enough to stop the radiation, this was also true in real life, which the writers used to inform its audience about radiation. There are many stories that contained the use of kryptonite in the comics since it was the only way to supporting characters and villains more important to the story. Comic book writers used kryptonite to emphasize the dangers of radiation, and imagined worst-case scenarios as the threat of nuclear war increased in these years. </p>

		<p>The self-imposed censorship came about from the reaction to the publication of <span id="title">Seduction of the Innocent</span> by Frederick Wertham in 1954 and some accidents that happened in which parents blamed the comic books. Wertham was a psychiatrist that said that Superman “has long been recognized as a symbol of violent race superiority” comparing him with Nazis, he also questioned Batman and Robins sexuality. <sup><a href="#19">19</a></sup> Comic books were blamed for juvenile delinquency, and the FBI said “kids under eighteen were responsible for half of America’s car thefts and burglaries and a rising share of robberies and rapes.” <sup><a href="#20">20</a></sup> The comic book industry had to self-censor to keep the industry going, the Comic Code Authority was created in 1954. The superheroes in both comics and television were now aimed towards a younger audience. The strengthening of the Comics Code Authority toned down crime magazines, but it said nothing about atomic weapons so many writers focused on that and ways to resolve conflicts without violence. There was an over reaction to the comic books, the campaign against Superman and Batman became known as the Great Comic Book Scare, borrowing from the term “Red Scare” for the communist threat. Wertham had a particular problem with Superman because he was the first superhero, he believed that comic books “arouse children fantasies of sadistic joy in seeing other people punished over and over again while you yourself remain immune. We have called it the Superman Complex.” <sup><a href="#21">21</a></sup> His descriptions of comic content were frequently misleading and exaggerated. This was a bad time for comic book superheroes, which became the reason why Superman was only in comic books and television in the early years of the Silver Age. Writers and producers had to change their strategy for the comic book and television series was now all focused toward a younger audience.</p>

		<p>There were a few things writers tried to do to change the idea that comics were bad and only for children. For example a Broadway musical “It’s a Bird, It’s a Plane, It’s Superman!” in 1966 where Bob Holiday played Superman tried but failed in changing peoples opinion. The musical did not add anything to the Superman myth but this incarnation wanted to legitimize the idea that comic books were good for adults as well as kids. <sup><a href="#22">22</a></sup> The show was a financial flop since Batman was becoming more popular at the time; it took away from the appeal of Superman singing. The opinion of superheroes being only for children did not change, so their previous focus on children continued with a Saturday morning cartoon, <span id="title">The New Adventures of Superman. </span>Filmation was the studio that had the rights to produce the cartoons in 1966. Bud Collyer returned as the voice for Superman and most of the radio cast signed up to return. The show was a hit, the series ran for three seasons, but the last two seasons had Superman with other DC superheroes. By 1973 the rights to DC Comics superheroes were passed to Hanna-Barbera. <sup><a href="#23">23</a></sup></p>
