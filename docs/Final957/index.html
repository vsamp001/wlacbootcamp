        <p>Superhero comics early on became a nexus between several art forms since they share characteristics with many of them but are different from all of them. What is the relationship between superheroes in comics and the superhero in radio, television and film and how do superheroes adapt while society and technology change? This paper aims at targeting these questions, focusing on the relationship between the different superhero comic book periods and the corresponding periods in other superhero mediums. Since superhero comics develop in response to changes in real world politics, social norms and popular culture, this creates different time periods for the superheroes, which can be divided into the Golden Age, Silver Age and Bronze Age and Modern Age. Since the superhero is changing in the comics it is also changing in the adaptations. Some of the adaptations do not translate well, therefore alterations to the superhero are made which include powers, relationships and origins, these changes then could influence the comic book and make it canon to the character. To answer these questions I am going to focus on one major example Superman, and look into the early comics, radio shows, animation and films. In 1938 the still developing comic book industry was shaken by the publication of <span id="title">Action Comics.</span> There had been comic strips before with heroes, but never like the one depicted in this one, this was the birth of the superhero. <span id="title">Action Comics No.1 </span>is the first appearance of Superman, which gave him a brief introduction of who he was, the powers he possessed and showed him saving people. Those 13 colorful pages made Superman a strong presence in the media, he had become a star in comic books, newspaper strips, radio, cartoons, movie serials, and television. The introduction of Superman to the world created a pantheon of superheroes in the Golden Age, but only a few managed to cross into other medias like Superman.</p>
