      <p>The adaptations before the Bronze Age contained a lot of fantasy, but that slowly kept changing to realism. People were now expecting realism, and as technology is advancing those expectations increase. By the Modern Age and currently realism is an important characteristic that writers have to take in to account when adapting. Comic books are the best way to represent the superheroes because there is no limitation to what the story could do. Video games also became the next medium for superheroes to tackle, but just like other mediums there has not been any good adaptaions that reflect the character. The first video game where Superman appears is in the Atari 2600 in 1978 and was well recieved. Others were released for different systems and in 1998 <span id="title">Superman 64</span> came out for the Nintendo 64, it is regarded as one of the worst video games ever made.</p>

      <p>The beginning of the Modern Age started with one of the worst movies <span id="title">Superman IV: The Quest for Peace</span>.  This pretty much killed any momentum of comic book characters becoming more accepted by the general audience. But in 1989 <span id="title">Batman</span> reignited the comic book movie genre, it took a few years for another movie staring Superman to be planned. <span id="title">Superman Lives</span>, an intended reboot of the Superman film series based on the 1992 DC comic <span id="title">The Death of Superman</span>, that was cancelled only three weeks before filming was set to begin in April 1998. <sup><a href="#31">31</a></sup></p>
      <p>The Modern began in 1985 following the <span id="title">Crisis on Infinite Earths</span> story, which rebooted continuity, and ended in 2011 with the Flashpoint storyline, which again rebooted continuity. This era includes the <span id="title">Death of Superman</span>, one of the best-selling comic stories of all time, introducing Doomsday. Both Superman and Doomsday are killed, taking each other down with their final blows. <span id="title">Funeral for a Friend</span> follows The Death of Superman, chronicling Superman's funeral and examines other characters' reactions to the death of the hero. Next, DC published the <span id="title">Reign of the Supermen</span> storyline, during which four different characters — a new Superboy, the cyborg Man of Tomorrow, the brutal Last Son of Krypton and Steel — are introduced as Superman, although none of them actually are. A de-powered Kal-El later surfaces in a Kryptonian battle-suit near the end of <span id="title">Reign of the Supermen</span>.

      <p> In the late 1980s and 1990s there were more adaptations to the Superman character, Superboy television series, <span id="title">Lois and Clark </span>television series, <span id="title">Superman: The Animated Series</span> cartoon. After the <span id="title">Reign of the Supermen</span> storyline, Lois and Clark are reunited they eventually marry in the 1996 special <span id="title">Superman: The Wedding Album</span>, it coincided with the marriage of the two characters in the television series <span id="title">Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman</span>. Superman returned to animation in the animated series Superman which was produced by Bruce Timm and Paul Dini of <span id="title">Batman: The Animated Series</span> fame. The series combined elements of both the Pre-and-Post-Crisis versions of the character and featured an all-star cast including Tim Daly as Superman, Dana Delany as Lois Lane, and Clancy Brown as Lex Luthor. By 2000s more animated shows and movies were adapted for Superman, the series <span id="title">Smallville </span>started and lasted ten years. <sup><a href="#32">32</a></sup> <span id="title">Superman Returns </span>was released in 2006, this adaptation did not work for the audience, the story was too tamed, and there was no action. It would take another few years for another Superman movie to come out. Thanks to the success of the Chirstopher Nolan Batman trilogy and the Marvel Cinematic Universe, a new take on Superman came to the big screen with <span id="title">Man of Steel</span> in 2013. </p>

      <p> <span id="title">Man of Steel</span> is the begining of the DC Extended Universe which will bring the Justice League to the big screen. Whereas <span id="title">Superman Returns</span> tried to repackage the world’s greatest superhero in a familiar  package of Richard Donner nostalgia, <span id="title">Man of Steel</span> posited ideas that are wholly relevant to the here and now. By way of the reboot, Superman is made a symbol to any kid who feels closeted, ostracized, unsure of their identity or is simply impatient for a greater purpose in life that awaits them. He’s a reminder that basic salt-and-earth principles and values never go out of style, that righteousness is a choice one must make. Never before has the Superman story had to exist in a modern world as complex as this one; Man of Steel dove headlong into those complicated waters (sexuality, immigration, ethnic identity, foreign politics – all issues this movie alludes to or touches upon) and still managed to present a strong argument for why Superman is the man that he is. <span id="title">Man of Steel</span> helped to establish an approach to superhero films that sets DC Entertainment apart from Marvel. Nolan’s Batman and Superman may exist in separate continuities, but the films he inspired about both have convinced many that fantastical heroes like Aquaman, Wonder Woman and Flash also have a shot at “grounded,” mature and modernized films. The next move for Superman is <span id="title">Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice</span> which comes out in March 25, 2016. </p>

      <p>Something to learn from the change in mediums is that they address social issues in their own way, most is tamed, but there are some instances that are more explicit like in the Bronze Age. Before societal and political changes would modify the character, but now its mainstream media that dictates how the adaptation will work. Since people expect action and realism the new adaptations that are currently happening are showing realism in a fantasy world. The films and television shows show how real people would react to a superhuman. </p>
