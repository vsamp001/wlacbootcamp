  <h2>Flash S02|E01 The Man Who Saved Central City </h2>
  <p>Time jump! After that great season finale cliff hanger all I  wanted to know what happened with the singularity! The episode didn&rsquo;t  immediately pick up where the season finale left off its six months in the  future. Something I love about the Flash is the cheesiness and the battle in  the beginning was exactly that but the episode becomes a bit more serious once  you see Harrison Wells and how the Flash is working alone. The writers didn&rsquo;t  dwell on the singularity too long and explained the rift between the Flash team.  Firestorm is the one who saved the city from the singularity but that cost  Ronnie Raymond&rsquo;s life. Cisco is always great with his one liners he is such a  relatable character.</p>

 Caitlin: That light was perfect bait. What made you think of that?
Cisco: I don't know. I think I saw it in a comic book somewhere.

<p>Iris has become a better character, she is making the team get back together and encourage Barry to do his best. The villain of the week is Atom Smasher, a metahuman from earth 2. He is not very developed, but he didn’t need to since it was just a way to introduce the new big bad of the season.  It is still not clear how Harrison Wells will come back but he did a good thing for Barry, not only left STAR Labs under his name but gave a confession to the murder of Barry’s mother. It was kind of emotional to see Barry’s dad out of prison and sad to see him leave town. But it makes sense since the father figure is filled by Joe West and the mentor figure will be filled by Jay Garrick. This episode solved the main problem Barry had in season one, got his dad out of prison and made more mysteries with the name Zoom and the arrival of Jay Garrick. I really loved the episode it had a lot of great moments. Sad that his dad won’t stay in Central City but it is understandable. There is some time travel logic that is iffy, and I want the writers to address that but I doubt it. Overall strong episode </p>
