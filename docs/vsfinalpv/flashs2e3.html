<h2>Flash S02|E03 Family of Rogues </h2>

<p>While the first two episodes of this season focused on setting up the threat of Zoom and the concept of multiple worlds and multiple Flashes, this week took a bit of a detour. The hunt for Zoom took a backseat to the return of sibling villains Captain Cold and Golden Glider. Luckily, the conflict was entertaining enough, and it didn’t prevent the show from making some progress on the Zoom front. The main appeal with this episode was seeing a softer, more vulnerable side of Leonard and Lisa Snart.</p>
<p>The show made a terrific casting choice in choosing Michael Ironside to play their abusive, domineering father. Ironside is, after all, the man who voiced Darkseid in the DC Animated Universe. It’s not hard to imagine that the children of a man who sounds like that and has a habit of inserting bombs into everyone’s heads would turn out a little kooky.</p>
<p>It was a lot of fun to see the dynamic between the Snarts and Team Flash play out and evolve over the course of this episode. We saw more of the grudging mutual respect form between Barry and Cold. Their previous encounter had a slightly sour note to it because Barry essentially let his fear of being exposed force him into tolerating Cold’s criminal activities in Central City. This episode alleviated that concern by proving that Barry is more concerned with the greater good than his own personal safety. He’s willing to risk Cold speaking out of turn, not just because he doesn’t think the man will truly betray him, but because he won’t risk any more lives.</p>
<p>The dynamic between Cisco and Lisa was one of the more enjoyable elements of the evening. This episode built on the previous sexual tension the two shared, but built a more genuine bond between them at the same time. To some extent you always have to question whether Lisa is being genuine when she shows her vulnerable side, but List made it clear through her performance that her character was in real danger and truly felt affection for her rescuer.</p>
<p align="center"> <img src="images/flashe3.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>The climactic heist scene was pretty entertaining as long as you didn’t dig too deep into the logic of it all. You know, questions like, “What were the Snarts planning to do about a tech guy if Barry didn’t show up?” and “Why didn’t Barry just knock out the elder Snart at super-speed before he could detonate the bomb?”. Positioning Lisa as a hostage of sorts helped give this sequence a little added drama. It’s always tough pitting Barry against foes who can’t match his speed and building a credible threat out of the situation, and more often than not hostages are the way to go.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it seems the purpose of this Flash/Captain Cold reunion was to position the latter character for his role in the upcoming Legends of Tomorrow. This episode reinforced the notion that Cold has a code, and a latent desire to do something more with his tools and abilities than rob people. I just hope this isn’t the last we see of the character before he spins out into that show. </p>
<p>This was another solid episode, and one that remained fairly lighthearted despite some of the darker elements at play. Seeing Barry, Cisco and Caitlin each deal with their respective romantic hurdles helped a lot in that regard. And with the interdimensional portal now stabilized, it seems Harrison Wells has made his way to Earth-1. For that reason alone, I’m eagerly looking forward to next week.</p>
